# Primate Evolution Simulator 🦍

*Biological Anthropology*


## Overview
This interactive web simulation demonstrates how environmental pressures drive evolutionary adaptations in primate populations. By manipulating variables such as tree density, predator count, and food availability, users can observe natural selection in real-time.

The project visualizes core anthropological concepts:
- **Visual Predation Hypothesis**: Insect hunting driving depth perception.
- **Savanna/Woodland Hypothesis**: Fragmented forests driving bipedalism.
- **Social Brain Hypothesis**: Predation pressure driving intelligence.

## Features

### 🎮 Scenarios (Guided Evolution)
- **Visual Predation**: High insect count, low fruit. Biases evolution towards **Depth Perception**.
- **Woodland**: Sparse, fragmented tree groves. Biases evolution towards **Bipedalism**.
- **Predator**: High tiger count. Biases evolution towards **Intelligence**.
- **Free Play**: Unlocks all sliders for manual experimentation.

## How to Run
1.  Clone specific repository or download the folder.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3.  Select a scenario from the sidebar to start the simulation.
